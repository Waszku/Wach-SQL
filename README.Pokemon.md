The project is about Pokemon and their statistics, types, generations etc. In the table I queried a couple of things
like TOP kind of types in the table, % growth, classification with using 'CASE'

The data was downloaded from kaggle.com and the questions was created by me.

Questions/tasks:

1. Number of Pokemons who have only one type.
2. Number of Pokemons who have two types.
3. Which Pokemons have the most Attack and the min Attack in the first generation?
4. Which generation has the most number of Pokemon?
5. What kind of Type_1 is the most in the table? 
6. TOP 3 the most kind of Type_1 in the table
7. What is number of Legendary Pokemon in the table?
8. TOP 10 Pokemons with the most 'Total' in the table.
9. Which generation is the most powerful (The max number of 'total' of every Pokemon in generation)
10. Classiffication according HP: not good, good, the best - choice.
11. Which generations have the total defense more than 10000?
12. The % difference between the max 'Total' Pokemon from First Generation and the Pokemon from 6th Generation in 'Total'.
