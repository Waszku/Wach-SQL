Project "Firma" was created completely by me. The Names, Data (numbers) were invented by me for project's needs.
Project cointains 13 employees who work in 5 departments/positions. 
I analyzed a couple of things you can see in the dashboard and meanwhile writing queries I added some columns like for example 'gender' or 'raises', "date of raise" etc.
